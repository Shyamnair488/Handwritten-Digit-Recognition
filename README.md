#Handwritten Digit Recognition with Flask and TensorFlow

This repository contains code for a simple web application that recognizes handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST dataset. The application is built using Flask for the backend and TensorFlow/Keras for the machine learning model.

#Features:

Upload an image of a handwritten digit and get real-time predictions.
The backend is powered by Flask, providing a simple and responsive user interface.
The CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy in digit recognition.

#Key Components:

Flask App: Utilizes Flask to create a user-friendly web interface.
TensorFlow Model: A CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Provides an interactive UI for users to upload images and receive predictions.

#Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the Flask application.
Upload handwritten digit images to get predictions instantly.

#Contributions:
Contributions and enhancements are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
